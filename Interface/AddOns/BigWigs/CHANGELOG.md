- bump version  
- Plugins/Bars: Add transparency option to nameplate bars, restrict their max width when using auto mode, make UI changes apply to them instantly, tweak defaults.  
- Plugins/Bars: Remove more code related to emphasizing nameplate bars and remove bar styling from nameplate bars, forcing the default (more transparent) style. We might need to add a separate option for this, as we can't guarantee the user's chosen bar style would be appropriate for a nameplate bar.
